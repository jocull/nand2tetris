# What is this?

This is my own personal progress through the project files provided at https://www.nand2tetris.org. The files are publicly provided as a resource alongside the textbook, and I claim no ownership over them.

The associated textbook, *The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles*, is available for purchase at https://smile.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/
